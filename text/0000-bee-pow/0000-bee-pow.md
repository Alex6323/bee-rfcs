# Summary

This RFC proposes a dedicated crate to perform proof-of-work (PoW) for a single gossip message, that attempts to become accepted and propagated by the network. 

# Motivation

In order to protect the network from spam each device that wishes to get a message (e.g. a value transaction) propagated by all the nodes needs a way to proove to the network, that it has invested the necessary amount of computational work either by doing the computation by itself, or by externalizing it using some PoW service provider. 

### Background info on PoW
Cryptographic hash functions are one-way-functions. That means in simple terms that given the output you cannot calculate the input from it. Proof-of-Work works by setting some constraint on the output like a certain number of zeros at the end or the beginning of the hash. It's completely arbitrary. It could be ten `1`s or the sequence `1234567890` because any particular sequence is equally likely. What matters is that your only chance to find an input that satisfies the constraint is guessing/brute-forcing it. You can also easily set the difficulty by making the constraint harder to satisfy (extend the sequence). So to check if PoW was correctly done all a validating node has to do is hash the given message which includes the nonce, and see if the constraint is satisfied. On the other hand the message publisher has to repeat the following cycle many times until it has found a valid nonce:
* Pick a nonce value (e.g. by simply increasing it, or choose it randomly)
* Hash the message together with selected nonce
* Compare if the hash satisfies the constraint given by the majority of the network

This process is called `Mining` and in this analogy the nonce is the nugget.

TODO

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

1. Write a summary of the motivation.
2. List all the specific use cases that your proposal is trying to address. 
   the software, for example using the "Job story" format:

TODO

### Job stories:
When I create a gossip message (e.g. a transaction), I want to be able to find a nonce, so that hashing the message and the nonce creates a hash that satisfies the constraint set by the network.

When I receive a gossip message, I want to be able to verify, that the contained nonce is valid, so that I know that the publisher of that message has at least invested some resource to find it.


`IMPORTANT NOTE`
It is important that this crate is independent from the particular hashfunction. Ideally it would not even depend on whether a trinary or a binary hashfunction is used.

# Detailed design

`This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the IOTA and to understand, and for somebody familiar with Rust
to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include
examples of how the feature is used.`

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
  before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
  of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  RFC?
